        <item>The main objective of Project Manager App is to help you (and your team) manage your projects.</item>
        <item>It is designed for small and uncommercial enterprises.</item>
        <item>Intentionally, this app was created to help fellow programmers deal with the \'messy\' part of creating a software (that is the management part).</item>
        <item>However, it can obviously be used to help manage other kinds of projects that require proper planning and systematic supervision - it\'s completely up to you.</item>
        <item>Here are some guidelines, that will tell you how to use Project Manager, by describing all the important components:</item>

        <item>As you can see in Description section, I created this App mostly for programmers to help them work on small projects.</item>
        <item>As a matter of fact, the idea for this app (and the will to write it) came to me while working on some other project, that took me quite a lot of time and some of it could be spared, if I had a similar organizing app.</item>
        <item>I am aware of the fact that this app isn\'t perfect and doesn\'t necessarily offer the appropriate tools for your particular project.</item>
        <item>If you don\'t like it, simlpy don\'t use it - I am sure you can find another app on the market that will suit your needs.</item>
        <item>And if you like Project Manager, then please rate it on the Play Market - it will take only a few seconds of your time - a few seconds that can really help me promote my app.</item>
        <item>Additionally, I would like to ask you for some feedback (positive or negative) - comments what you like and dislike about my app, what you would like to change or add - that kind of stuff. Please, bear in mind that this is my first Android app, so don\'t be very harsh on me :)</item>
